# UniSaaS.UniCORE.Prometheus

**SCAFFOLD-ANCHOR repository — initial scaffold 2026-06-04.**

Full scaffolding, upstream-fork integration, and source-code work all pending a fresh dedicated kickoff arc. This initial commit exists to lock the repository's identity, licence position, and place in the UniCORE Sanity Check fleet so the work cannot be forgotten.

## What this repository is

`bryanunitek/UniSaaS.UniCORE.Prometheus` is the **Prometheus** family member: SaaS-deployment-shape public gift surface. Documentation today; source code at certification.

**Family purpose:** Open-source metrics collection — time-series metrics backend for UniCORE.GVB observability.

**Deployment shape:** This is the **SaaS-shape** member of the family. It tracks the same upstream codebase as [`UniCORE.Prometheus`](https://github.com/bryanunitek/UniCORE.Prometheus) (on-prem shape) but carries SaaS-specific configuration, multi-tenant isolation patterns, and cloud-native deployment artefacts.
